# Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Collaborative Surgical Planning in Complex Robotic Procedures

This paper introduces a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to facilitate collaborative surgical planning for complex robotic procedures. By simulating the expertise of various surgical specialists through specialized agent roles, the framework enables comprehensive pre-operative planning that integrates diverse clinical perspectives. Each agent-representing surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and patient safety specialists- contributes domain-specific knowledge through a structured dialogue protocol. The framework incorporates medical imaging data, electronic health records, and relevant literature to generate detailed surgical plans, contingency protocols, and risk assessments. Preliminary evaluation in simulated robotic partial nephrectomy cases demonstrates the framework's ability to identify critical considerations that might be overlooked in conventional planning processes. This approach represents a significant advancement in applying generative AI to surgical decision support, potentially improving patient outcomes through more thorough preoperative planning while maintaining human surgeon oversight and final decision-making authority

# Problem
Current surgical planning methods rely heavily on multidisciplinary team meetings or sequential consultations. These are often constrained by:
- Scheduling and coordination difficulties
- Incomplete integration of diverse clinical expertise
- Lack of real-time synthesis across multiple medical modalities
- Such limitations can result in suboptimal plans for complex robotic procedures.

# Solution
The proposed solution is a multi-agent system where each agent is powered by a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) role. The system:
- Represents different medical roles (Surgeon, Radiologist, Anesthesiologist, etc.)
- Follows a collaborative dialogue protocol
- Integrates data from Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical imaging, labs, and literature
- Produces detailed surgical plans, contingency strategies, and risk assessments

# Key Contributions
- A novel multi-agent LLM system for collaborative surgical planning
- Domain-specific LLM role specialization simulating real clinical teams
- Integration of multimodal clinical data (EHR, imaging, literature)
- Probabilistic convergence protocol for consistent and valid plan generation
- Public code repository for reproducibility

# Results
- 87% match with gold-standard multidisciplinary team plans (vs. 63% for individual specialists)
- 75% of cases included clinically novel insights not present in any single expert‚Äôs plan
- 85% of outputs were rated "clinically appropriate" or "highly appropriate" by surgeons
- High consistency, comprehensiveness, and explainability via structured dialogue

# Architecture Highlights
- Agents: Surgeon, Radiologist, Anesthesiologist, Safety Specialist, Coordinator
- LLM Base: GPT-4 / Claude 2 with fine-tuned prompts per role
- Dialogue Management: Role-specific communication, conflict resolution, final synthesis
- Evaluation: 20 case studies in robotic partial nephrectomy procedures
