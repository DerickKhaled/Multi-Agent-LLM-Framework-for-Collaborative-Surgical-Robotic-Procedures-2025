# Multi-Agent-LLM-Framework-for-Collaborative-Surgical-Planning-in-Complex-Robotic-Procedures

This paper introduces a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to facilitate collaborative surgical planning for complex robotic procedures. By simulating the expertise of various surgical specialists through specialized agent roles, the framework enables comprehensive pre-operative planning that integrates diverse clinical perspectives. Each agent—representing surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and patient safety specialists—contributes domain-specific knowledge through a structured dialogue protocol. The framework incorporates medical imaging data, electronic health records, and relevant literature to generate detailed surgical plans, contingency protocols, and risk assessments. Preliminary evaluation in simulated robotic partial nephrectomy cases demonstrates the framework's ability to identify critical considerations that might be overlooked in conventional planning processes. This approach represents a significant advancement in applying generative AI to surgical decision support, potentially improving patient outcomes through more thorough preoperative planning while maintaining human surgeon oversight and final decision-making authority
